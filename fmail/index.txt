<body>
<pre>
 * Purpose:
 * ~~~~~~~~
 *      To accept information from an HTML form via HTTP and mail it to recipients.
 *
 * What does this PHP script do?
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *      On your web site, you may have one or more HTML forms that accept
 *      information from people visiting your website.  Your aim is for your
 *      website to email that information to you and/or add it to a database.
 *      FormMail performs those functions.
 *
 * Quick Start
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~
 *      1. Edit formmail.php and set TARGET_EMAIL for your requirements (near
 *              line 256 in this file - replace "yourhost\.com" with your mail server's
 *              name).  We also strongly recommend you set DEF_ALERT (the next
 *              configuration below TARGET_EMAIL).
 *      2. Install as formmail.php (or other name ending in .php) on your web server.
 *      3. Create an HTML form and:
 *              - specify a hidden field called "recipients" with the email address
 *                of the person to receive the form's results.
 *              - in the your form tag set the action attribute to
 *                the formmail.php you uploaded to your web server
 *
 *      Once you have FormMail working, you may be interested in some advanced
 *      usage and features.  We have HOW-TO guides at www.tectite.com which
 *      describe many of the advanced processing you can do with FormMail.
